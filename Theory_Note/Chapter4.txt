**Reporting Aggregated Data Using the Group Functions**
*******************************************************

Group Function:
	The functions operate on sets of rows to give one result per group are called group functions. These sets may  comprise the entire table or the table split into groups.
	
Guidelines for using group functions:
	1. DISTINCT makes the function consider only nonduplicate values; ALL makes it consider every value, including duplicates. The default is ALL and therefore does not need to be specified. 
	2. The data types for the functions with an expr argument may be CHAR, VARCHAR2, NUMBER or DATE.
	3. All group functions ignore null values. To substitute a value for null values, use the NVL, NVL2 or COALESCE functions.
